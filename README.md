### QC prep

**Pass by Value:** The method parameter values are copied to another variable and then the copied object is passed, that's why it's called pass by value

**Pass by Reference:** An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method, that's why it's called pass by reference


String pool stores strings and prevents duplicates to save memory
