## Week 1 Day 2 notes

Primitive Datatypes to Java:
- boolean (1 bit)
- byte (8 bit)
- short (16 bit)
- int (32 bit)
- long (64 bit)
- float (32 bit)
- double (64 bit)
- char (16 bit)



### QC prep

**Pass by Value:** The method parameter values are copied to another variable and then the copied object is passed, that's why it's called pass by value

**Pass by Reference:** An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method, that's why it's called pass by reference


String pool stores strings and prevents duplicates to save memory


Java Operators:
- postfix (x++, x--)
- prefix  (++x. --x)
- **multiplicative (* / %)**
- **additive (+, -)**
- shift (<< >> >>>)
- **relational (<, >, <=, >=)**
- equality (==, !=)
- bitwise AND (&)
- bitwise exclusive OR (^)
- bitwise OR (|)
- logical AND (&&)
- logical OR (||)
- ternary (expression ? true option:false option)
- assignment (=, +=, -=, /=, %=)


**short circuit** - If the outcome can be determind by only one side, it won't even look at the other side...if the evaluation of a logical expression exits in between before complete evaluation
